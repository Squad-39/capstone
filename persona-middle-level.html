<h1>Persona</h1>
<h2>User Name</h2>
<p>Lara Park</p>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>
    As a casual/mid-tier user, Lara is browsing the Squad Finder app during her time off from work to find a squad to join for non-competitive rounds in a team-based fps game.
</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>PC based gaming. Has a modest, budget gaming build desktop that runs Windows 11. Razer peripherals. Personally has products (Apple MacBook Pro - IOS Big Sur, and Apple Iphone 13. </p>

<h2>Proficiency</h2>
<p>Lara is proficient in using technology for entertainment and work. Lara uses technology and the internet everyday to stay connected on social media with friends (local and online). Lara built her own gaming desktop, and knows more than the average technology consumer about computers.</p>

<h2>Attitudes & Needs</h2>
<p>Lara works full time at a local coffee shop/eatery. In her spare time, she enjoys playing PC games. She needs an app to locate other squads quickly so that she can be queued into a match rather quickly. Lara would like to have an efficient app to find other players that she can trust to play the game fairly while also having fun.</p>
<p>Lara is a friendly person who likes to meet other gamers, and even help out those new to the gaming scene. Lara expects the app to filter out toxic, rude players who may exploit or use the app for non-gaming reasons. Lara also expects the app to match her with plays within her own MMR level. </p>

<h1>Interaction Flow</h1>
<h2>Use Case</h2>
<p>Since becoming a manager, she typically only has 1-4 hours of free time during the week to play games online. Sometimes her usual friends who play aren’t available or have conflicting schedules, therefore, has found herself joining other teams of random players or needing other people to fill her squad on short notice. On a Friday night, Lara found herself needing one more person to join her squad of three other friends. </p>

<p><strong>Precondition:</strong> Lara is signed into her Squad Finder account.</p>
<p><strong>Postcondition:</strong>  Lara is queued with four (4) other people who want to play Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege as a team. They are on the relatively same level, utilize in-game controls to communicate in a non-toxic manner, and have fun. </p>
