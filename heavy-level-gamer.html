            <h2>Persona</h2>

                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Amalia Petra</p>

                <p><strong>Proficiency:</strong> Amalia is a PC power user. She has to have her games run at the most optimum levels, as she prefers to run her games at 2K - 4K resolution at 144hz üòç refresh rates.

She occasionally takes the proper care of her PC and peripherals, her motto "It has to run right" üßê is what she stands by. Amalia runs updates on all of her components and software on Sunday evenings to ensure everything is operable.

                    Amalia stays active within her friends Discord server community revolving around First-Person Shooter games.

                <p><strong>Attitudes and Needs:</strong> Amalia loves playing video games.
