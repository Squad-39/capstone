            <h2>User Story</h2>

                <p>"As a High Level Gamer on PC, I want to look for other high experienced squad members to game with, so that we can top the leader boards."</p>

            <h2>Persona</h2>

                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Amalia Petra</p>

                <p><strong>Technology</strong></p>

                <p>Hardware: Amalia has a custom-built PC from Cyber Power PC with an i9-12900K CPU. She also has 32 GB of RAM and an RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. She uses one 32" widescreen monitor running 4K resolutions at 144 hz refresh rate. She uses all Razer peripherals to include a Razer Huntsman RGB keyboard, wireless Naga gaming mouse, and a Kraken V3 wireless gaming headset to complete her setup.</p>

                <p>Software: Amalia runs Windows 11 Home version on her PC. She also uses game launchers to play her PC games from Steam, BattleNet, Epic Games, Origin/EA, and Uplay. Then when Amalia gets in a squad team, she uses Discord for communication with her team.</p>

                <p><strong>Proficiency:</strong> Amalia is a PC power user. She has to have her games run at the most optimum levels, as she prefers to run her games at 2K - 4K resolution at 144hz üòç refresh rates. Amalia prefers gaming with keyboard and mouse, as it gives her the upper advantage against console gamers. She occasionally takes the proper care of her PC and peripherals, her motto "It has to run right" üßê is what she stands by. Amalia runs updates on all of her components and software on Sunday evenings to ensure everything is operable.

                    Amalia stays active within her friends Discord server community revolving around First-Person Shooter games. She primarily interacts within the community and is heavily relied on when the newest content is out because she does extensive research in how to complete the levels. She stays up-to-date with current with the latest gaming news through YouTube and is always in the comments section voicing her opinions.</p>

                <p><strong>Attitudes and Needs:</strong> Amalia loves playing video games. She particularly likes playing games that have multiplayer features in them primarily because she likes to play with others. She prefers that her teammates are as knowledgeable of the games as she is because she does not like teaching people that are new to the game. When the newest content is out she makes the effort in being one of the first in finishing it. She easily rages üò° when her teammates are not reliable. Amalia enjoys being the squad lead making the call-outs in leading her teams to success.</p>
